# CLIPmeetsGAN
The main goal of this project is to create an application that can automatically 
summarize user uploaded video content. The application enables the user to keyword 
search the video content for actions or objects that occurred within it. The 
application will utilize OpenAIâ€™s CLIP in tandem with other models in order to 
accomplish this task. In order to showcase the functionality and viability of 
this application we will utilize the USC crime dataset.
